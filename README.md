# ⭐ Data Warehouse & Analytics Engineering Project
End-to-End SQL Warehouse | ETL Pipelines | Data Modelling | Power BI Analytics

This project demonstrates my ability to design and build a complete data warehouse using SQL Server, Medallion Architecture, SQL-based ETL pipelines, and Power BI reporting.
It reflects the practical skills I’ve developed as I work toward becoming a Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and AI Engineer, mastering data from raw ingestion to automated analytics.

#
# 📌 Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of modern data engineering:

1. Data Architecture:
Built using Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ensure clean data flow, auditability, and scalable analytics.

2. ETL Development:
Created SQL-based ETL processes that extract raw CSV files (ERP & CRM systems), clean and transform them, and load them into structured warehouse layers.

3. Data Modelling:
Designed a Star Schema in the Gold Layer, including Fact tables and Dimension tables optimized for analytics.

4. Analytics & Reporting
Built a Power BI report focusing on:
-Customer behaviour
-Sales trends
-Product performance
-Key business KPIs

Helping stakeholders access meaningful, actionable insights.

# 🏗 Data Architecture (Medallion Layers)

- Bronze Layer — Raw Data
 - Ingested directly from CSV files
 - No transformations
 - Maintains original source data for audit and traceability

- Silver Layer — Clean & Standardised Data
  - Applied transformations and validations
  - Cleaned duplicates
  - Standardised formats & structures
  - Prepared for modelling

- Gold Layer — Business Layer
  - Star Schema with FactSales, DimCustomer, DimProduct, and others
  - Optimized for Power BI and analytical queries
  - Business logic applied
